        ITS Campus ITS, ITS News – Current tensions between Russia and Ukraine require both parties to frequently utilize technology and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to carry out their missions. Inspired by this phenomenon, Professor from t15he Department of Mathematics, Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember (ITS) Prof Subchan SSi MSc PhD conducted research related to Navigation, Guidance and Control (NGC) in unmanned systems to improve surveillance performance.

    <div class="isiberita">Through research which was used as his inauguration scientific oration as ITS’s 162nd Professor, Subchan said that the unmanned system he developed was strongly guided by NGC. He explained that navigation is the process of determining location, guidance acts as a guide to the path that must be followed, and control is an actuator to adjust the vehicle’s trajectory as desired. “Without NGC, aircraft and unmanned ground vehicles would not be able to operate properly,” said the doctoral alumnus of the Department of Aerospace Powers and Sensors, Cranfield University, England.
